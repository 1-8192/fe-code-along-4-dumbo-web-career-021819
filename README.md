### Building Layouts

Lets start out by making a new feature branch in Terminal by typing `git checkout -b columns` and press return.

...

It's now time to version our changes using Git. To do so, in Terminal type `git add .` and press return. Then type `git commit -m "add columns and fixed header and social bar"` and press return. Then push up this feature branch `git push -u origin columns` and press return. Next merge the changes into your master branch. Type `git checkout master` and press return, then `git merge columns` and press return. Then `git push origin master` and press return.

After you finish, make sure you install Firefox if you haven't already as it is required for the screenshot tests to run. Then, type `learn` command from Terminal to run local tests (Mac) or type `learn-test` for Windows.

After all tests are passing submit a pull request on Github and move on to the next lesson!
